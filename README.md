<h1>Sales-Analysis</h1>

<p>
  I am hereby sharing the Pizza Superstore Dashboard in Power BI, It’s a powerful and interactive data visualization tool that provides a comprehensive view of the performance, sales, and various key metrics of a retail Pizza superstore. 

This dashboard is designed to help business analysts, managers, and decision-makers gain insights into the store's operations and make informed decisions.

Key values for my dashboard include the insight of: Daily And Monthly Trends for Total Orders, % of sales by Pizza Size and Category.

1). Used cards for showing the crucial data of the KPI for Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizza Sold, Total Orders, Average pizza per order.📇

2). Use of slicers for making the dashboard user-friendly. The end user can use these slicers to filter to get better understanding of the dashboard. ✂️

3). Used line Chart to show the Monthly Trends For Total Orders . 📈

4). A Donut Chart to show the % Of sales of Pizza by Pizza Category & Size. 

5). A clustered Bar Chart to show the Total pizza sold by category. 📊

Key Learning:
1. Understanding the data to get best insight.
2. Extraction and Filtering of the given data.
3. Using the Power Query Monitor to transform and data.
4. How to modify and clean data.
